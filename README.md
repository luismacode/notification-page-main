## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- utility class
- javascript
- BEM Naming

### What I learned

Through the development of this challenge I was able to reinforce my knowledge of HTML and CSS and go over basic Javscript concepts.

### Continued development

At some point in the future I can do this same challenge only with javascript since I think that the templates of the notifications could be generated easier with javascript instead of putting everything with html or it would also be an option to make web components for this challenge.
